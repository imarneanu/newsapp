Udacity News App

### Guardian API Key is required.

In order for the News app to function properly an API key for guardianapis.com must be included with the build.

We recommend that each student obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to the projectâ€™s gradle.properties

`MyGuardianApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY>"`
